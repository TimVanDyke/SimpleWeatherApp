### description of app
I made this simple app based off the link above, I wanted to become familiar with how Python works with GUI's and get my feet wet with API calls in this language. I am very surprised how clean the Python code is

## Running the app
To run the app make sure that you've installed Pillow and requests 
```bash
pip install requests
```
```bash
pip install Pillow
```
